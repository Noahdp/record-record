# Record Record React Conversion Notes

## Project Overview

- Original project: SwiftUI app for album collection, details, reviews, and Discogs API integration.
- Target: Modern React (Next.js + Chakra UI) web app.

## Conversion Steps

3. **Rebuild UI components using React and Chakra UI.**
   - Album list, album detail, reviews, etc.
4. **API Integration:**
   - Use Next.js API routes to proxy Discogs API calls (keeps keys safe, allows custom logic).
   - Example: `/pages/api/albums.ts` for album search/fetch.
5. **State Management:**
   - Use React hooks (`useState`, `useContext`) or Zustand/Redux for larger state needs.
6. **Authentication (if needed):**
   - Use Auth0, Clerk, or NextAuth.js for user login and protected features.
7. **Database (if needed):**
   - MongoDB (with Mongoose) or PostgreSQL (with Prisma) for user data, reviews, collections, etc.
8. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy to Vercel (recommended for Next.js) or Netlify.

## Useful Swift File References

- `Models/Album.swift` (see TypeScript above)
- `Models/AlbumDetail.swift`
- `Models/CommunityReview.swift`
- `Services/DiscogsAPI.swift` (API logic to port)
- `ViewModels/AlbumCollectionViewModel.swift` (state management logic)
- `Views/AlbumDetailView.swift`, `AlbumCard.swift`, etc. (UI to React components)

## Tips for the New Project

- Use Chakra UI for fast, accessible UI components.
- Keep API keys and secrets out of the frontendâ€”use API routes.
- Modularize code: separate types, components, pages, and API logic.
- Document any custom logic or conversion quirks in this file as you go.

## Next Steps

- Reference this file in your new project for context.
- Copy over and adapt models, logic, and UI as needed.
- Update this file with any new conversion notes or decisions.
